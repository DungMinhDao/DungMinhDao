# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=DungMinhDao" alt="https://github.com/DungMinhDao" />

## ðŸ”­ About me
I am working as an AI Engineer at FPT Software AI Center. Currently, I'm doing research on Deep Learning methods for Tabular data to apply to the current company's project.

As the Vice President of SOICT Innovation Club, I and my friends organize many programming-related events for students in our School and University, as well as doing projects for application purposes or for competitions/hackathons.

I am still finishing my Computer Science degree at Hanoi University of Science and Technology
